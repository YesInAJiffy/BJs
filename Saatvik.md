# Sum of Angles of a Polygon
(n-2) * 180


**Ques** A regular polygon has each exterior angle measuring 15Â°. Find the number of sides of this polygon. <br>
**Ans** Interior Angle = 180 - 15 = 165 <br>
Sum of all interior angles = 165.n (where n is the number of sides of the polygon). <br>

(n-2) * 180 = 165 * n <br>
15 n = 360 <br>
n = 24 <br>
